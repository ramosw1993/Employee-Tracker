# Employee-Tracker

## Project Description

The employee tracker prompts a set of options on the console with options to choose from pretaining to a company, user selects which tables it would like to see and the program will display it nicely.

The employee tracker started being a very fun project but it quickly turned into a very tough project for myself, I just got comfortable with routes and mysql then adding a row to a table is quick a feet. I had a alot of trouble adding into the tables, however, I almost shed a tear when I manage to print the view all departments tables and the others, it was a very changelling but worth while assignment. Will be finishing it in the near future.

The following are screen shots of how a couple of my tables look in the console.
